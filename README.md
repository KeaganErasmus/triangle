## Learning OpenGL and Rust
This is another project that I am doing to learn Rust. I have always wanted to do some graphics programming so why not kill two birds with one stone. I was following this tutorial -> [Rust and OpenGL from scratch](https://nercury.github.io/rust/opengl/tutorial/2018/02/08/opengl-in-rust-from-scratch-00-setup.html)

# Tools used
* Rust
* gl-rs
* SDL2

# Features
Currently all this code is doing is rendering the classic OpenGL triangle. I might continue this project in a different framework such as **Gluim** as using gl-rs is kind of ignoring rules of **Rust** there is a lot of unsafe code blocks because you are making straight OpenGL calls
